            <p>
                I written this website by myself. I use it for recording some idea about HTML/CSS development and testing some function.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am very interested in programming language. Although I don't having any programming course before I finished my secondary school, I still spend so much time on learn different programming language. SUch as Java, javaScript, C#, C++, HTML/CSS etc...

        <div class="parallax p2">
            <h1>
                Gaming and Sofrware development and say hello to the world
            </h1>
            <p>
                Let's talk about how did I get start on this.
            </p>

            <p>
                Java is the first programming language of my life. As like as other, the "Hello world!" class is the first programm that I written and run on the world.
            </p>
            <h2>
                "I wanna design my own game!"
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is the reason I start my learning. So I first join the course about gaming and software development. But when I spend a year on studing gaming development, I relized i can do more but only the gameing development.
